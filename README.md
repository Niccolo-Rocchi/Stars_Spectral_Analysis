 Since even before the discovery of stellar spectra, scientists had tried to find ways to categorize stars. 
 In a [previous article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/acc974), the authors seek for predicting the stellar subtype (0-9) of M dwarfs. 
 In the present work we enhance their approach by using a kind of graph connectivity among stars and its spectral characteristics, also extending the learning procedure to every Solar neighborhood star. 
 We compare three methodologies, namely: Spectral Clustering, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). 
 MLP is shown to be the best approach for this task, while Spectral Clustering gives us peculiar information about stellar structure.
