 Since even before the discovery of stellar spectra, scientists had tried to find ways to categorize stars. 
 In a [previous article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/acc974), the authors seek for predicting the stellar subtype (0-9) of M dwarfs. 
 In the present work we enhance their approach by using a kind of graph connectivity among stars and its spectral characteristics, also extending the learning procedure to every Solar neighborhood star. 
 We compare three methodologies, namely: Spectral Clustering, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). 
 Surprisingly, Spectral Clustering classification performs better than deep net approaches.
